Tech Stack and Tools
Programming Language: Python (due to its extensive libraries for email automation and scalability).
Libraries:
imaplib and smtplib: For IMAP and SMTP operations.
google-api-python-client or Gmail API: To work with Gmail effectively.
pyzmail or email module: For parsing and composing emails.
Redis or RabbitMQ: For queueing and managing large-scale email tasks.
SQLite or PostgreSQL: To store email metadata and logs.
Infrastructure:
Use cloud services like AWS or GCP to handle load and ensure reliability.
Consider an email service provider like SendGrid for bulk email handling.
Efficiency Tools: Cursor/V0 or similar IDEs with AI assistance.
Milestones
Email Management Backend (Day 1–7):
Set up IMAP and SMTP handlers for Gmail and other providers.
Authenticate with OAuth2 for secure Gmail access.
Reading and Replying to Emails (Day 8–14):
Write functions to fetch, parse, and reply to emails.
Build rules to determine how replies are generated.
Spam/Promotion Handling (Day 15–20):
Use Gmail API features to pull emails from spam.
Experiment with headers and content that reduce spam scores.
Scalability and Load Testing (Day 21–28):
Implement queuing for processing 100,000 emails.
Test and optimize for performance and concurrency.
IP Reputation Management (Day 29–34):
Use DKIM, SPF, and DMARC records for domain reputation.
Limit email rates and monitor bounce/complaint rates.
Final Testing and Submission (Day 35–40):
Conduct end-to-end tests.
Document the process and ensure code is production-ready.
Resources Needed
Access to Gmail API and Developer Console: To manage Gmail-related tasks.
Dedicated Server or Cloud Credits: For hosting and testing at scale.
Email Accounts: Test accounts for Gmail and other providers.
Documentation: References for Gmail API, IMAP, SMTP, and anti-spam best practices.

Setup Instructions
Place your Gmail API credentials file as credentials.json in the same directory.
Run the script. It will prompt you to log in to your Google account if you haven't already authenticated.
Test it with a Gmail account to see it fetch and reply to emails.
